# Menu Surfraw

A short little Bash script that uses rofi or dmenu to prompt you for an Elvis and a search term with surfraw.

## Installation

This'll work anywhere. You could place it in `~/.local/bin` or `/usr/bin` and have it built into dmenu, I use it in i3 with this line in my configuration: `bindsym $mod+Mod1+space exec ~/.dotfiles/menu-surfraw`, it's up to you!

## Preview

ELVIS:
    This is the same as surfraw, any Elvis you have installed. Can be left
    blank, as you will be prompted for this in dmenu/rofi.

    left blank as you will be prompted for this in dmenu/rofi.
```
